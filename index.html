        <h1>Technology</h1>
        <p>Technology refers to the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry. It
        encompasses tools, machines, systems, and techniques that are developed to solve problems, improve efficiency, and
        enhance human capabilities. Over time, technology has transformed all aspects of life, from communication and
        transportation to healthcare and entertainment.
        
        In the modern world, technology is evolving rapidly with innovations like artificial intelligence (AI), robotics,
        blockchain, and biotechnology reshaping industries and societies. It plays a central role in economic growth, social
        connectivity, and solving global challenges like climate change and health crises. However, technological advancements
        also raise concerns about privacy, security, ethical implications, and job displacement.
        
        Overall, technology continues to shape the future by driving progress in almost every field, making life more convenient
        but also posing new challenges that require thoughtful consideration.</p>

                    <strong>AI:</strong>Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think,
                    learn, and solve problems. AI systems can process large amounts of data, recognize patterns, make decisions, and improve
                    their performance over time without direct human intervention.
                    
                    AI is categorized into two types: **narrow AI**, which is designed for specific tasks (like voice assistants or
                    recommendation systems), and **general AI**, which would possess the ability to understand and perform any intellectual
                    task that a human can do (still theoretical).
                    
                    AI is revolutionizing various industries, including healthcare (for diagnostics and personalized treatment), finance
                    (for fraud detection and trading algorithms), and transportation (through self-driving cars). Despite its benefits, AI
                    raises ethical concerns about privacy, job displacement, and decision-making transparency.<code>.accordion-body</code>

                    <strong>BIOMETRICS:</strong> Biometrics refers to the use of unique physical or behavioral characteristics to identify and authenticate individuals.
                    Common biometric traits include fingerprints, facial features, iris patterns, voice recognition, and even behavioral
                    patterns like typing rhythm.
                    
                    Biometric systems are widely used for security purposes, such as unlocking devices, verifying identities for access
                    control, or in border security. These systems are considered more secure than traditional password-based methods because
                    biometric traits are difficult to replicate or forget.
                    
                    While biometrics offer convenience and enhanced security, they also raise privacy concerns regarding the storage and
                    potential misuse of personal data.</code>

                    <strong>Coding:</strong>Coding, also known as programming, is the process of writing instructions that a computer can execute to perform
                    specific tasks. It involves using programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, or JavaScript, to create software
                    applications, websites, games, and systems.
                    
                    In coding, developers write lines of code that instruct the computer on how to carry out operations like calculations,
                    data manipulation, or user interaction. Each programming language has its own syntax and rules, but all are designed to
                    translate human logic into machine-readable commands.
                    
                    Coding is a fundamental skill in the tech industry, enabling the development of innovative technologies. It's used in
                    various fields, including artificial intelligence, web development, data science, and more, and has become an essential
                    skill in many modern careers.<code>.accordion-body</code>
